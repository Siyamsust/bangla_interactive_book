This Arduino code is designed to create an interactive Bangla book using an Arduino board and a DFPlayer Mini MP3 player module. The system allows users to navigate through different pages and play corresponding audio files for each button press.


How It Works:

Initialization:
The Arduino initializes the DFPlayer Mini and sets up pins for all buttons with internal pull-up resistors.

Volume Adjustment:
Users can increase or decrease the volume using dedicated buttons.

Page Selection:
Users select a page using page navigation buttons.

Audio Playback:
Pressing any of the 12 buttons on the selected page triggers playback of a corresponding audio file.

Key Components:

Libraries and Initialization:
1.Includes Arduino.h and DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h.            
2.Creates an instance of the DFPlayer Mini (myDFPlayer).                

Pin Definitions:
1.Defines pin numbers for volume control, page select, and 12 interactive buttons.

Variables:
1.currentPage tracks the current page.
2.volume sets the initial volume level.
3.fileMap maps each button on each page to specific audio files.
4.lastButtonState detects button presses.

Setup Function:
1.Initializes serial communication and the DFPlayer Mini.
2.Configures all buttons as input with internal pull-up resistors.

Loop Function:
1.Checks volume control buttons to adjust volume.
2.Monitors page select buttons to switch pages.
3.Detects button presses on the current page to play corresponding audio files.

Summary
This code enables an interactive Bangla book, allowing users to adjust volume, select pages, and play audio files by pressing buttons, enhancing the educational experience with tactile and auditory feedback.
